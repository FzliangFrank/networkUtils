Bundle of shiny modules for editing and interact with small amount of
graph data.

This package is intended for R developers who have already familiar with
basic workflow `shiny` and `shiny module`. If you are not already
familiar with *shiny module* , have a skim at Hadley Wickhamâ€™s
[*Mastering Shiny*](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html).

There are three pairs pre-written shiny module in this R package that
will help you build interactive graph-based shiny application quickly.
They are:

- `mod_visNetModification_<ui/server>` for visualize, main graph and
  editing.
- `mod_visNetInteraction_<ui/server>` for interactively select data
- `mod_fileUploader_<ui/server>` for ingesting node/edge list
- In addition `mod_visNet_server`, a serverside short-cut for use
  *mod_visNetModification_server* and *mod_visNetInteraction_server* at
  the same time.

This development heavy depends on `visNetwork` package and works most
responsive with below 500 nodes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `networkUtils` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("FzliangFrank/networkUtils")
```

## Quick Run

``` r
library(networkUtils)
run_simpleNetworkUtilApp()
```

also hosted on
[shiny.io](https://frank-the-tank.shinyapps.io/networkutils/)

## Introduction

Network/Graph data are structured usually in *edge list* or *adjacency
matrix*. This data formats are not easy for human to interact with or
editing.

The modules written in this package {networkUtils} let human
interactively search and editing network based data interactively. Much
like

`networkUtil` package makes it possible.

**selecting node or edge based on attributes**

using `mod_visInteractive_ui()` and `mod_visInteractive_server`

![](man/figures/demo_selector.gif) Selecting it in side bar will select
corresponding node on the network. In this instance it tells me deleting
this node will disconnect three other nodes!

**editing graph structure**

using `mod_visModification_ui()` and `mod_visModification_server()`

![](man/figures/demo_editor.gif)

**file upload and download server**

using `mod_fileUploader_ui()` and `mod_fileUploader_server()`.

### Key take away.

You need two shiny module made it possible:

- `mod_visNetModification_server(id)` (ui) in charge of the logic to
  editing networkgraph. This function return reactive graph.
- `mod_visNetInteraction_server(id)` (ui) in charge of all the dynamic
  UI and selection by node.

Make sure the id matches. You can build your own shinyApp using these
two module.

``` r
library(shiny)
library(igraph)
ui <- fluidPage(
  column(4,
         mod_visNetInteraction_ui("id")
         ),
  column(8, 
         mod_visNetModification_ui("id")
         )  
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  myGraph = reactive({
    g = igraph::make_tree(30, 2)
    V(g)$attr1 = sample(LETTERS, length(V(g)), replace = T)
    V(g)$id = seq(length(V(g)))
    g
  })
  sessionGraph = mod_visNetModification_server("id", 
                                               myGraph,
                                               hard_delete = F
                                               ) # Output is reactive value
  mod_visNetInteraction_server("id", 
                               reactive(sessionGraph$Current)
                               )
  observe({
    print(class(myGraph))
    print(class(myGraph()))
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Note always pass igraph as reacitve expression. The output of
mod_visNetModification_server is always a list of two:

- `$Current` for the graph you are interacting with now
- `$Main` for graph you are happy with (one after you press save)

This is a basic version control.

### Customise how you want editing graph.

`visNetwork_graphChange` generates a massive list of command as what has
been changed.

There is an function to transfrom command generated by visNetwork api
into a modified graph. If you have a database set up you can use this
function to export changes graph back to database.

- `modify_graph_i`

For example

``` r
list_of_command = list(
  cmd = 'addNode',
  id = '31'
)
modify_graph_i(graph, list_of_command)
```

Detail of how that list should work. Go visit `visNetwork`
documentation.

This function currently only accept one command at a time.

### Siny App Build Using this Module

``` r
library(networkUtils)
run_simpleNetworkUtilApp()
```
